Juggling academics, projects and life needs structure. Use time-boxing, clear weekly goals and a priority matrix (urgent/important). Protect deep-work blocks and schedule smaller tasks for low-energy moments. Track progress weekly and refine your routine. Small repeated habits beat last-minute marathons. Prioritize rest and recovery — sustainable productivity is the goal.
